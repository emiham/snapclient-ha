# Snapclient for Home Assistant

This addon lets you use your Home Assistant server as a client for [Snapcast](https://github.com/badaix/snapcast). 

Right now it's very bare-boned, but it's running on my system without any issues. If you install it and have any problems please open an issue and I will see what I can do. 

# Configuration

Set up your server and port in the configuration tab of the addon.
