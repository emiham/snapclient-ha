# Snapclient for Home Assistant

This add-on lets you use your Home Assistant server as a client for
[Snapcast](https://github.com/badaix/snapcast).

# Configuration

The default host IP is `127.0.0.1` (i.e. the computer running Home Assistant),
and the default port is `1704`. You can change this in the configuration tab.

You can also optionally set the `hostID`.
